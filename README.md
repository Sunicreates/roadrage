- React Router DOM for client-side routing
- Firebase Authentication (Google Sign-In)
- Firebase Firestore for user data storage
- MongoDB with Mongoose for backend user and post data persistence
- Axios for HTTP requests to backend services
- Tailwind CSS and custom CSS for styling
- React Scripts with react-app-rewired for build and development
- Testing libraries: @testing-library/react, jest-dom, user-event
